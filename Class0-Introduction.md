Welcome to my simple class, I found myself reviewing some Git resources and was largely dissapointed. Infact, the only solid resource I could find was this visual cheat sheet, which I totally recommend bookmarking.

Therefore I have decided to throw this together in the hopes that it may be useful to future learners. This resource will make great use of the spaced repetition tool ANKI, for the memorization related aspects of Git.

If you do not have anki, or dont care to use it, by all means I encourage you to still read through this source, but alas I can not promise it will be as effective.

The format of this class will be...

1. A general introduction to the organization of git, these lessons will be about the reasoning and design philosophy that resulted in Git being structured in the way it is. It will answer the questions "What?", "Why?", and "How?" for each of the five Git boxes.
* the stash
* the workspace
* the index
* the local repo
* the upstream repo


2. The second section will be centered around the most common and useful Git commands, what they do, how to call them, and where they would be used.

3. The next section will be centered around the most common and useful command *options* for the commands from section 2, again the empahsis will be placed on what they do, how to call them, and where they would be used.

4. The fourth section will be centered around the less frequent, less useful Git commands. You should be set by section three, but If you make it this far good for you

5. The final section will be about the options for the commands from section 4. 

After the end of every set of similar lessons, an updated anki deck will be provided, and this will allow your anki deck to be maximally efficient, as you will only be memorizing things that you have already learnt. All the learner has to do is update their anki deck to the version specified at the end of each unit.
