Lean, Efficient, Organized 

The goal is to distill the ProGit book into 200 proof.

The class is formated as such...
1. Conceptual Introduction
2. Git Basics
3. Git Core Commands
4. GitHub Core Commands
5. Git Core Command Options
6. Git Innesential Commands
7. Git Innesential Command Options

After section 3 you should be able to use git.

Anything after 3 is voluntary, but I'd recommend continuing till 5.

This resource will revolve around the provided Anki deck.

The deck will start small, as you progress new cards will be provided.

Please update your deck whenever prompted.
