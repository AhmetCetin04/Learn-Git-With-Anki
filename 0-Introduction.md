Lean, Efficient, Organized 

The goal is to distill the ProGit book into 200 proof.

The class is formated as such...
1. Conceptual Introduction
2. Git Basics
3. Git Core Commands
4. Git Core Options
5. Git Innesential Commands
6. Git Innesential Options

After section 3 you should be able to use git.

Anything after is voluntary, but I advise finishing 5.

This resource will revolve around the provided Anki deck.

The deck will start small, as you progress new cards will be provided.

As you progress update your deck whenever prompted.
