To best understand Git, we must first understand why it exists. 

To put it simply, keeping track of the various states of a program as it undergoes development is both hard and tedious, and doing it in a team is practically impossible. 

Hence the boomer devs from before the flood created automatic version control software, and a little later on, the same dude who created the linux kernel built one for himself. 

Because his program, named Git, worked natively on the preferred operating system of most developers, they quickly adopted the software and it has been the industry standard ever since.

So now that we know what Git is, and more or less why it exists lets talk a little about what it actually does. 

Of the things Git does, these are the most important...
1. Automatically documents and stores the various states of a codebase as it undergoes development
2. Forces developers to maintain some semblance of documentation.
3. Allows us to clone projects, make changes to cloned project, then recombine our old and new project.
4. Allows developers to store and retrieve these various documented project states online, which makes it possible for developers to work together without any of them feeling the need to create a software killdozer. 

So with this out of the way, lets start talking about the Git boxes. 

The Git boxes are abstract storage containers where we can store various forms of our projects.
