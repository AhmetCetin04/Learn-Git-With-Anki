Git exists to archive the various states of a program as it undergoes development.

Of the things Git does, these are the most important...
1. Automatically documents and stores the various states of a codebase as it undergoes development
2. Forces developers to maintain some semblance of documentation.
3. Allows us to clone projects, make changes to cloned project, then recombine our old and new project.
4. Allows developers to store and retrieve these various documented project states online, which makes it possible for developers to work together without any of them feeling the need to create a software killdozer. 

So with this out of the way, lets start talking about the Git boxes. 

The Git boxes are abstract storage containers where we can store various forms of our projects.
