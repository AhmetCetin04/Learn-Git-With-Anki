To best understand Git, we must first understand why it exists. 

To put it simply, keeping track of the various states of a program as it undergoes development is both hard and tedious, and doing it in a team is practically impossible. 

Hence the boomer devs from before the flood created automatic version control software, and a little later on, the same dude who created the linux kernel went on to develop another one of these tools. However, he made his program, which he named Git, work natively on the linux system. Due to Git being so convenient on the operating system most devs were already using, it was quickly adopted and became the industry standard.


 allows multiple people to work on a project with multiple versions at the same time, and it forces them to maintain a certain level of documentation and organization while doing so, while simulatenously storing all the previous versions of the project. This last part ensures that when shit hits the fan we can easily revert back to before shit hit the fan, we can compare to past versions and quickly figure out a). What code was changed before shit hit the fan, and b). Who to blame for shit hitting the fan.

So with this out of the way, lets start talking about git.
