Git exists to archive the various states of a program as it undergoes development.
</br></br></br>
There are three states files can exist in...
* changed (referred to as modified)
* In line to be archived (referred to as staged)
* archived (referred to as commited)
</br></br></br>
Beyond the states our files can have, there are five sections our files can reside within...
* Workspace, where modified files sit until they are ready to be staged
* Stash, where WIP files can temporarily be stored, in order to free up the workspace for other things
* Index, where staged files sit until they are ready to be commited
* Local Repository, where files are archived on your computer
* Upstream Repository, where files are archived on a server 

To get a more comprehensive understanding of how files move around git, play around with the website linked below, I personally recomend bookmarking it.

Lets talk more about the sections, why they exist and how they interact with git.
