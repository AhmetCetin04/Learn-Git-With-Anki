Git exists to archive the various states of a program as it undergoes development.

There are three states files can exist in...
* changed (referred to as modified)
* In line to be archived (referred to as staged)
* archived (referred to as commited)

Beyond the states our files can have, there are five sections our files can reside within
* Workspace, this is where you edit files
* Index, this is where files in line to be archived sit until they are archived
* Stash, this is where you can store files that are changed but not yet ready to be archived
* Local Repository, this is where files are archived on your computer
* Upstream Repository, this is where files are archived on a server
