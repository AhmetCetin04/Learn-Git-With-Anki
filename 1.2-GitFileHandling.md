By now you should have an abstract idea of what Git is, but you may be wondering how Git actually stores information.

Git makes heavy use of pointers and hash functions...
- A pointer is an object that points to one or more other objects
- A hash function turns any input into a fixed-size, unique name
</br></br>

An important detail to note is that pointers in Git don't point to memory addresses, instead they store the name of an object.

An object is a file that stores data and pointers, Git stores theses objects in the git/objects/ folder.

Before Git can save objects to the git/objects/ folder, it must first ensure each has a unique name.

This is done by feeding certain traits from the object into a hash function.

Therefore, the filename of any Git object is just the hash generated from the objects attributes.

Once Git calculates the hash for a object, it checks to see if the object exists, if it doesn't, it builds the object under the new hash.
</br></br>

There are two pointers, and three objects that are relevent to understanding how Git achieves its version control...
  1. Branch pointers - Point to the latest commit within a line of commits, automatically tracked by Git
  2. HEAD pointer - Point to the commit your work space is currently running, only one per Git repo
  3. Blob Objects – Every file's binary data is stored in a blob
  4. Tree Objects – Store the hashes of various blobs and subtrees, similarly to folders
  5. Commit Objects – Record a tree hash, one or more parent commit hashes, and other data specific to the commit
</br></br>

For each object Git inputs different information to the hash function...

For the blob: The size and contents of the file</br>For the tree: The user-given name and hash for each Blob and Subtree within the tree, and the size of the tree</br>For the Commit: The author of the commit, the time, the commit message, the parent commit/s, the tree hash, the size of the commit, etc
</br></br></br>

Some examples will help demonstrate the brilliance of this system.

Imagine we have the following folder...

```
ProjectFolder
├── file1.txt
├── file2.txt
└── file3.txt
```

If we initialized a Git repo for this folder, this is what the relationships between the objects and pointers would look like...
```
                 +------------------+
                 |       HEAD       |
                 +--------+---------+
                          | 
                          v
                 +------------------+
                 |  branch: master  |
                 +--------+---------+
                          | 
                          v
 +-------+     +----------------------+
 | Null  | <-- |      hash: mno       |
 |       |     |  (initial commit)    |
 +-------+     +----------+-----------+
                          | 
                          v
                 +------------------+
                 |    hash: jkl     |
                 |     (tree)       |
                 +--------+---------+
                          |
      +---------------------------------------+
      |                   |                   |
      v                   v                   v
  +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
  | hash: abc |     | hash: def |     | hash: ghi |
  |  (blob 1) |     |  (blob 2) |     |  (blob 3) |
  +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
```
and the git/objects/ folder would be as such
```
git/objects/
├── abc (file1.txt binary)
├── def (file2.txt binary)
├── ghi (file3.txt binary)
├── jkl (Hash references to abc, def, ghi)
└── mno (Tree reference to jkl, and a parent reference to NULL)
```
</br>

Important things to note...
1. The head and branch pointers aren't in the git/objects/ folder, as they aren't objects
2. The head and master branch pointers are automatically initialized by Git
3. Blobs are the only objects that contain the text files' data
4. Blob objects aren't entries within the tree object file, tree objects aren't entries within the commit object file
5. Arrows indicate that the hash name/s of the object/s being pointed to are literally written within the parent file
</br></br></br>

Now lets say I make a small edit to file2.txt, add my work to the index, and commit it to the local repository.

What does the Git structure look like now?


```
                                                                         +------------------+

                                                                                  |
                                                                                  v

  +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+       +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
```
And what does the git/objects/ folder look like?
```
git/objects/
├── abc 
├── def
├── ghi
├── jkl
├── mno
├── pqr (NEW contents of file2.txt)
├── stu (References blobs abc, PQR, and ghi)
└── vwx (References tree stu, and parent references mno)
```
</br>

Important things to note...
1. file1.txt and file2.txt have kept the same hash, and they dont have a new file within the git/objects folder
2. Blob 2, tree 1 and the initial commit still exist within git/objects/, and havent been modified
3. Branch and head pointers were again automatically updated.
</br></br></br>

And what would the git structure and git/objects/ file look like if we commited with no changes...

```
And the git/objects folder...
```
git/objects/
├── abc
├── def 
├── ghi 
├── jkl 
├── mno 
├── pqr
├── stu 
├── vwx 
└── yzα (References tree stu, and parent references vwx)
```
</br>

Important things to note...
1. The data within the blobs is unchanged, so the hash function still returns the same hashes, so Git reuses the same object files
2. The blobs referenced by the tree are unchanged, so the hash function returns the same hash, so Git reuses the same object file
3. The tree and blobs referenced by the commit are unchanged, but due to the time difference, the commit has a different hash
