Before we continue, you may be wondering why we have branches?

Imagine we want to add some new feature that could potentially break our program.



```
                                               +------------------+
                                               |       HEAD       |
                                               +--------+---------+
                                                        |
                                                        v
                                               +------------------+
                                               |  branch: master  |
                                               +--------+---------+
                                                        |
                                                        v
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+

 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+
The final diagram from 1.2, we will ignore the blobs and trees for now
```

Is it possible to develop this feature without running the risk of breaking the entirety of our codebase?

Yes it is, we continue to add commits to our Git project, and when it breaks, we can revert to the last working commit.

But now lets imagine that while you are working on this branch, Jimmy from the UI team is simultaneously trying to add a feature of his own.

Now we have an issue. When your code breaks, reverting the code base will delete all of Jimmy's hardwork.

Now image we have 100 Jimmys...

Git's offered solution regarding this predicament is Branching.

Instead of commiting our changes to master, lets imagine that we create a new branch. 
```
                                               +-------------------+
                                               |        HEAD       |
                                               +-------------------+
                                                        |                         
                                                        v 
                                               +------------------+    
                                               |  branch: master  |    
                                               +--------+---------+   
                                                        |                         
                                                        v                         
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+  
 |   hash: mno   | <-- |    hash: vwx    |  <-- |   hash: yzα    | 
 | (Init commit) |     | (second commit) |      | (third commit) |    
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+  
                                                        ^
                                                        |
                                            +------------------------+
                                            | branch: YourNewFeature |
                                            +------------------------+
```

And now lets commit our changes to it instead.

```
                                               +------------------+    
                                               |  branch: master  |    
                                               +--------+---------+   
                                                        |                         
                                                        v                         
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+         +-----------------+
 |   hash: mno   | <-- |    hash: vwx    |  <-- |   hash: yzα    |  <----  |    hash: βγδ    |
 | (Init commit) |     | (second commit) |      | (third commit) |         | (fourth commit) |
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+         +-----------------+
                                                                                    ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                        +------------------------+
                                                                        | branch: YourNewFeature |
                                                                        +------------------------+
                                                                                    ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                           +-------------------+
                                                                           |       HEAD        |
                                                                           +-------------------+
```

Now Jimmy can create his own branch as well, specific to the feature he is currently working on...

```
                                               +------------------+    
                                               | branch: Jimmy's  |    
                                               +--------+---------+   
                                                        |                         
                                                        v                         
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+         +-----------------+

 | (Init commit) |     | (second commit) |      | (third commit) |         | (fourth commit) |
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+         +-----------------+
                                                         ^                          ^
                                                         |                          |
                                                +----------------+      +------------------------+
                                                | branch: master |      | branch: YourNewFeature |
                                                +--------+-------+      +------------------------+
                                                                                    ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                           +-------------------+
                                                                           |       HEAD        |
                                                                           +-------------------+
```

And Jimmy can freely commit his changes...

```
                                                                           +-----------------+

                                                                           +--------+--------+

                                                                           |  (fifth commit) |
                                                                           +-----------------+

                                                                                    |
                                                                        +------------------------+
                                                                        | branch: YourNewFeature |
                                                                        +------------------------+
                                                                                    ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                           +-------------------+

```

Now if you accidentally break your branch, Jimmy can keep centering his divs, and if Jimmy accidentally deletes the database we can keep working on our changes no problem.

Also note that other teammates can still make commits to the master branch, and that these new commits won't influence either your or Jimmy's work.
