Before we continue, you may be wondering why we have branches?

Imagine we want to add some new feature that could potentially break our program.



```
                                               +------------------+
                                               |       HEAD       |
                                               +--------+---------+
                                                        |
                                                        v
                                               +------------------+
                                               |  branch: master  |
                                               +--------+---------+
                                                        |
                                                        v
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+
 |   hash: mno   | <-- |    hash: vwx    |  <-- |   hash: yzα    |
 | (Init commit) |     | (second commit) |      | (third commit) |
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+
The final state of the diagram from the previous lesson: 1.2. We currently ignore the blobs and trees.
```

Is it possible to develop this feature without running the risk of breaking the entirety of our codebase?

Yes it is, we continue to commit to our master branch, and when it breaks, we can revert to the last working commit.

But now lets imagine that while you are working on this branch, Jimmy from the UI team is simultaneously trying to add a feature of his own.

Now we have an issue. When your code breaks, reverting the code base will delete all of Jimmy's hardwork.

Now imagine there is a hundered Jimmys...

Yeah, not your best day at the office.

Git's offered solution regarding this predicament is Branching.

Instead of commiting our changes to master, lets imagine that we create a new branch...
```
                                               +-------------------+
                                               |        HEAD       |
                                               +-------------------+
                                                        |                         
                                                        v 
                                               +------------------+    
                                               |  branch: master  |    
                                               +--------+---------+   
                                                        |                         
                                                        v                         
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+  
 |   hash: mno   | <-- |    hash: vwx    |  <-- |   hash: yzα    | 
 | (Init commit) |     | (second commit) |      | (third commit) |    
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+  
                                                        ^
                                                        |
                                            +------------------------+
                                            | branch: YourNewFeature |
                                            +------------------------+
```

And we commit to our new branch instead...

```
                                               +------------------+    
                                               |  branch: master  |    
                                               +--------+---------+   
                                                        |                         
                                                        v                         
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+         +-----------------+
 |   hash: mno   | <-- |    hash: vwx    |  <-- |   hash: yzα    |  <----  |    hash: βγδ    |
 | (Init commit) |     | (second commit) |      | (third commit) |         | (fourth commit) |
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+         +-----------------+
                                                                                    ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                        +------------------------+
                                                                        | branch: YourNewFeature |
                                                                        +------------------------+
                                                                                    ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                           +-------------------+
                                                                           |       HEAD        |
                                                                           +-------------------+
```

Now Jimmy can create his own branch as well, specific to the feature he is currently working on...

```
                                               +------------------+    
                                               | branch: Jimmy's  |    
                                               +--------+---------+   
                                                        |                         
                                                        v                         
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+         +-----------------+
 |   hash: mno   | <-- |    hash: vwx    |  <-- |   hash: yzα    |  <----  |    hash: βγδ    |
 | (Init commit) |     | (second commit) |      | (third commit) |         | (fourth commit) |
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+         +-----------------+
                                                         ^                          ^
                                                         |                          |
                                                +----------------+      +------------------------+
                                                | branch: master |      | branch: YourNewFeature |
                                                +--------+-------+      +------------------------+
                                                                                    ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                           +-------------------+
                                                                           |       HEAD        |
                                                                           +-------------------+
```

And Jimmy can freely commit his changes...

```
                                                                           +-----------------+
                                                                           | branch: Jimmy's |
                                                                           +--------+--------+

                                                                      |    +-----------------+

                                                +----------------+                  ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                        +------------------------+
                                                                        | branch: YourNewFeature |
                                                                        +------------------------+
                                                                                    ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                           +-------------------+
                                                                           |       HEAD        |

```

Now if you accidentally break your branch, Jimmy can keep centering his divs, and if Jimmy accidentally deletes the database we wont even notice. 

Also note that other teammates can still make commits to the master branch, and that these new commits won't influence the new branches.

Now heres the question, once you finish your feature, how the hell does it get added back to the actual project?

This is called merging, essentially we take the most recent commits from two branches, find their most recent shared ancestor, and combine their data in a very specific way.

As an example lets switch to the latest master commit θικ, and merge in Jimmy's branch εζη, with some hypothetical blobs.

```

Remember when we switch our branch, our head shifts to that branch.
```

Recognize that the most recent shared commit between them is the yzα commit from the master branch.

               |MERGED|
               +------+
               | A4   |
               | B6   |
               | C4   |
               | ?    |
               | E7   |
               +------+
Notice...
- A4 never changed, so we keep it as is in the merged commit.
- B5 was changed to B6 in a recent commit so Git keeps the change.
- C3 was changed to C4 in a recent commit so Git keeps the change.
- D2 was changed in both recent commits, but to different values. Git has no clue what to save for D in the merged commit.
- E6 was changed to E7 in both recent commits, so Git saves the change.
```

So as we see Git couldn't resolve the D blob. What does this mean? What can we do about it?

This means that Git is asking us to manually fix whatever is causing the merge conflicts.

To resolve the issue we pick to keep either D3, D4, or we choose to write up a brand new change to replace both D3 and D4. 

Don't worry about how we do this just yet, we will get there, for now ensure you have a strong conceptual understanding of what it means to merge in Git.

Once we pick which change we want to keep, we stage and commit our revisions. Leaving us with the following...

At this point Jimmy's branch is redundant and can be deleted.
Also note how the merge commit has two parent commits, rather then just one.
