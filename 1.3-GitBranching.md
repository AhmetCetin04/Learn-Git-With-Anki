Lets recall our last diagram from 1.2, we don't currently care about the blobs or trees so lets ignore them for now...

Imagine we want to add some new feature that could potentially break our program.

Is it possible to develop this feature within the main branch without risking others code?

The short answer is that it isn't.
</br></br>

We need somewhere external to develop our code, test it to ensure that it works, and only then can we incorporate it back into main.

To do so, we create Branches of our program.
