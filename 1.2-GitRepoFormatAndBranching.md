By now you should have an abstract idea of what Git is, but you may be wondering how Git actually stores information.

Git uses three types of objects to store data, which are stored in the git/objects/ folder.

1. Blob – Essentially a file, contains raw info
2. Tree – Essentially a folder, references blobs and other trees
3. Commit – References a tree and parent commits 

Furthermore, Git names each of these objects by running them through a hash function (a function that turns any data into a fixed-size, functionally unique digital name).

For each object, it uses different information for the input for the hash function.

For the blob: The size and contents of the file</br>For the tree: The user-given name and hash for each Blob and Subtree within the tree, and the size of the tree</br>For the Commit: The author of the commit, the time, the commit message, the parent commit/s, the tree hash, the size of the commit

Additionally, we can create branches to point at specific commits, think of these as a head to a linked list.

To illustrate why and how Git does this, lets run through an example...

Imagine we have the following folder, containing the following files...

ProjectFolder</br>
├── file1.txt</br>
├── file2.txt</br>
└── file3.txt

If we initialized a Git repo for this folder it would look more like this.

```
                 +------------------+
                 |  branch: master  |
                 |                  |
                 +--------+---------+
                          |
                          v
 +-------+     +----------------------+
 | Null  | <-- |      hash: mno       |
 |       |     |  (initial commit)    |
 +-------+     +----------+-----------+
                          |
                          v
                 +------------------+
                 |    hash: jkl     |
                 |     (tree)       |
                 +--------+---------+
                          |
      +---------------------------------------+
      |                   |                   |
      v                   v                   v
  +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
  | hash: abc |     | hash: def |     | hash: ghi |
  |  (blob 1) |     |  (blob 2) |     |  (blob 3) |
  +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
```
and the git/objects file would be as such

git/objects/</br>
├── abc (contains the actual contents of file1.txt)</br> 
├── def (contains the actual contents of file2.txt)</br>
├── ghi (contains the actual contents of file3.txt)</br>
├── jkl (contains the hash references abc, def, ghi)</br>
└── mno (contains the tree reference jkl, and a parent reference to null)</br>
(The branch object is stored in a seperate file)

Now lets say I make a small edit to file2.txt, add my work to the index, and commit it to the local repository.

What does the git structure look like now?


```
                                                                         +------------------+

                                                                                  v

                 +------------------+                                    +------------------+

      v                   v                   v               v                   v                   v

  +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+       +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
```
And what does the git/objects file look like?
git/objects/</br>
├── abc (Contents of file1.txt)</br> 
├── def (OLD contents of file2.txt)</br>
├── ghi (Contents of file3.txt)</br>
├── jkl (References blobs abc, def, and ghi)</br>
├── mno (References tree jkl, and parent references null)</br>
├── pqr (NEW contents of file2.txt)</br>
├── stu (References blobs abc, PQR, and ghi)</br>
└── vwx (References tree stu, and parent references mno)</br>
(The branch object is still stored in a seperate file)
