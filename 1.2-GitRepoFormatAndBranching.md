By now you should have an abstract idea of what Git is, but you may be wondering how Git actually stores information.

Git uses three types of objects to store data, which are stored in the git/objects/ folder.

1. Blob – Essentially a file, contains raw info
2. Tree – Essentially a folder, references blobs and other trees
3. Commit – References a tree and parent commits 

Furthermore, Git names each of these objects by running them through a hash function (a function that turns any data into a fixed-size, functionally unique digital name).

For each object, it uses different information for the input for the hash function.

For the blob: The size and contents of the file</br>For the tree: The user-given name and hash for each Blob and Subtree within the tree, and the size of the tree</br>For the Commit: The author of the commit, the time, the commit message, the parent commit/s, the tree hash, the size of the commit
</br></br></br>
To illustrate why and how Git does this, lets run through an example...

Imagine we have the following folder, containing the following files...

ProjectFolder</br>
├── file1.txt</br>
├── file2.txt</br>
└── file3.txt

If we initialized a Git repo in this folder it would look more like this.

```

 +-------+     +----------------------+
 | Null  | <-- |      hash: mno       |
 |       |     |  (initial commit)    |
 +-------+     +----------+-----------+
                          |
                          v
                 +------------------+
                 |    hash: jkl     |
                 |     (tree)       |
                 +--------+---------+
                          |
      +---------------------------------------+
      |                   |                   |
      v                   v                   v
  +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
  | hash: abc |     | hash: def |     | hash: ghi |
  |  (blob 1) |     |  (blob 2) |     |  (blob 3) |
  +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
```
remember, tree jkl does not hold or contain any of the information in the text files, it just contains the hashes for each file that was previously within the project folder.
