Each class adds new cards to the Anki deck. 

The deck within branch 3.3 holds all the cards for lesson 3.3 AND all the cards from before, branch 3.4 holds all the cards from branch 3.3 plus the cards specific to lesson 3.4.

Once you finish a lesson, lets say 3.2, you will need to sync your deck on your local computer to the deck in branch 3.2. 

You have two options to do this...
1. Download it manually from the GitHub browser (boring)
2. Use git and github cli to open this repo on your local computer and switch to the desired branch

Below are the directions for the second option...
</br></br>

Download Git and Github cli

- Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

- GitHub: https://cli.github.com/
</br></br>

Now go to your terminal and run the following commands...

```
git clone https://github.com/AhmetCetin04/Learn-Git-With-Anki.git

cd Learn-Git-With-Anki/

git switch desiredBranch
```

Replace "desiredBranch" with the  name of the branch you want to switch to.
</br></br>

Now when you launch the deck from your computer, it will automatically launch Anki.

Best of luck with your studies!
