Each class adds new cards to the Anki deck. 

Each branch holds a different versions of the same Anki deck.

Once you finish a lesson, lets say 3.2, you will need to sync your deck on your local computer to the deck in branch 3.2. 

You have two options to do this...
1. Download it manually from the GitHub browser (boring)
2. Use git and github cli to checkout the desired branch

Below are the directions for the second option...

Download git and github cli

Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
GitHub: https://cli.github.com/

after you have installed both go to your terminal and run the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/AhmetCetin04/Learn-Git-With-Anki.git

cd Learn-Git-With-Anki/

git switch <desiredBranch>
```

Obviously replace "desiredBranch" with the actual branch name you want to switch to.

Now when you try to open the deck within your local repository, it will automatically launch Anki.

Best of luck with your studies!
