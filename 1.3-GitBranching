Lets recall our last diagram from 1.2, we don't currently care about the blobs or trees so lets ignore them for now...

```
                                               +------------------+
                                               |       HEAD       |
                                               +--------+---------+
                                                        |
                                                        v
                                               +------------------+
                                               |  branch: master  |
                                               +--------+---------+
                                                        |
                                                        v
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+
 |   hash: mno   | <-- |    hash: vwx    |  <-- |   hash: yzÎ±    |
 | (Init commit) |     | (second commit) |      | (third commit) |
 +---------------+     +-----------------+      +----------------+

```

Why might we want to add a second branch, what would such an operation look like?
