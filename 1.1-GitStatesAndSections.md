Git exists to archive the various states of a program as it develops.
</br></br>
Files in Git cycle through three states...
* Changed (referred to as modified)
* In line to be archived (referred to as staged)
* Archived (referred to as commited)

These files live within branches (slightly different versions of the same project), which in turn live in the Git Repository (your project folder under Git’s control).
</br></br></br>
Additionally there are the five Git "sections"...
1. The Workspace
   - The Workspace is the only section where you can modify Git files. If you have access to a Git repository—local or remote—you can download or switch to any of its branches and work with them here. Modified files sit here until they are staged, at which point they move onto the Index.
2. The Stash
   - When you need to open a different branch, but still have modified files in your Workspace, that is when you use the Stash. It exists to provide you a storage alternative to commiting WIP files. You can easily move files back and forth between the Stash and Workspace.
3. The Index
   - This is how git protects developers from themselves. If changes aren't added to the Index they wont end up in the Local Repository after you commit. It exists to prevent accidental file corruption or modification. Staged files sit here until they are commited, at which point they are stored in the Local Repository.
4. Local Repository
   - This is the Git directory on your computer. It is a database of all commits, and it keeps track of which commits belong to which branch. You can push your Local Repository to a Remote Repository, causing the remote repository to sync itself to your local repo.
5. Remote Repository
   - This is the distributed git archival system. It is a database of all commits made by all users to the Remote Repository (like a Github repo), Behaves very similarly to the Local Repository. Users can fetch or clone from the Remote repository to get the remote files on their own computers.
